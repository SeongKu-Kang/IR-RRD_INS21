# Item-side Ranking Regularized Distillation for Recommender System

## 1. Overview
This repository provides the source code of our paper: Item-side Ranking Regularized Distillation for Recommender System, accepted in Information Sciences'21.


In the paper, we propose Item-side ranking Regularization (IR) method for ranking distillation in Recommender System. The proposed IR method utilizes item-side ranking information, effectively preventing the student model from being overfitted and enabling the student model to more accurately learn the teacherâ€™s prediction results.

## 2. Evaluation
We evaluate the effectiveness of IR with the state-of-the-art ranking distillation method, RRD (CIKM'20).

### 2.1. Leave-One-Out (LOO) protocol
We provide the leave-one-out evaluation protocol used in the paper.
The protocol is as follows:
* For each test user
	1. randomly sample two positive (observed) items 
		- each of them is used for test/validation purpose.
	2. randomly sample 499 negative (unobserved) items
	3. evaluate how well each method can rank the test item higher than these sampled negative items.

### 2.2. Metrics
We provide three ranking metrics broadly adopted in the recent papers:  HR@N, NDCG@N, MRR@N.
The hit ratio simply measures whether the test item is present in the top-N list, which is defined as follows:

where &delta; is the indicator function, U<sub>test</sub> is the set of the test users, p<sub>u</sub> is the hit ranking position of the test item for the user u. 
On the other hand, the normalized discounted cumulative gain and the mean reciprocal rank are ranking position-aware metrics that put higher scores to the hits at upper ranks.
N@N and M@N are defined as follows:

![Large](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\text{N}%20@%20N%20=%20\frac%20{%201%20}%20{%20|%20\mathcal%20{%20U%20}%20_{test}%20|%20}%20\sum%20_%20{%20u%20\in%20\mathcal%20{%20U%20}_{test}%20}%20\frac%20{%20\log%202%20}%20{%20\log%20\left(%20p%20_%20{%20u%20}%20+%201%20\right)%20}\text{,%20M}%20@%20N%20=%20\frac%20{%201%20}%20{%20|%20\mathcal%20{%20U%20}_{test}%20|%20}%20\sum%20_%20{%20u%20\in%20\mathcal%20{%20U%20}%20_{test}%20}%20\frac%20{%201%20}%20{%20p%20_%20{%20u%20}%20})


We also provide the training log and the learning curves of the proposed method. You can find them in /logs folder and the attached jupyter notebook.
